## How to play

Play it using any modern web browser on Desktop and Mobile. You can control the spaceship with your keyboard or overlay buttons on a touch screen.

Asteroids: The Full Game is a small exploration game. It can be controlled with arrow keys and Space to fire. On mobile, click the screen to show overlay buttons. Use "f" for forwards and "w" for weapon to control the ship.

The player does not need to fear dying as none of the objects have collision.

The map has an asteroid field and four planets. The player can shoot the asteroids and fling through space using the gravity of the planets.
